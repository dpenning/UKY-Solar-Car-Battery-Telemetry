Battery Telemetry
=================
This is Code written by the Solar Car team 2013-2014 lead by David Pennington. For questions email me at dpenning1@gmail.com.

What does this code do?
-----------------------
This code reads serial input from our reciever and interprets it through a parser and then displays the current car information onto the screen as well as logging into a tab delimited file. This will be immensly useful for testing the new battery system as well as monitoring the car during the race.

What are we reading?
--------------------
input comes from our car's transmitter with information like
 - single battery voltage/current
 - array voltage/current
 - car speed
 - motor current
 - potentially other things

What should i work on?
