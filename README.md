Battery Telemetry
=================
This is Code written by the Solar Car team 2013-2014 lead by David Pennington. For questions email me at dpenning1@gmail.com.

What does this code do?
-----------------------
This code reads serial input from our reciever and interprets it through a parser and then displays the current car information onto the screen as well as logging into a tab delimited file. This will be immensly useful for testing the new battery system as well as monitoring the car during the race.

What are we reading?
--------------------
input comes from our car's transmitter with information like
 - single battery voltage/current
 - array voltage/current
 - car speed
 - motor current
 - potentially other things

What should i work on?
----------------------
Check out the [issues](https://github.com/dpenning/UKY-Solar-Car-Battery-Telemetry/issues?state=open) page

What if I dont know enough to work on something?
------------------------------------------------
Here is some reading material for you to get caught up on.
 - [Python 2.7.5](http://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/)
 - [PySerial](http://pyserial.sourceforge.net/)
 - [PyQT](http://zetcode.com/tutorials/pyqt4/)

I feel Overwhelmed
------------------
Thats ok, its a learning process go through the tutorials above and then come back to this page
